/*Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
c. Tax rate: #15% of the first $300
20% of the next $150
25% of the rest
Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
tax law.
