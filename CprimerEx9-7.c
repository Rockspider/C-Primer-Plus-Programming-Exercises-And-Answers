/*Write a program that reads characters from the standard input to end-of-file. For each
character, have the program report whether it is a letter. If it is a letter, also report
its numerical location in the alphabet. For example, c and C would both be letter 3.
Incorporate a function that takes a character as an argument and returns the numerical
location if the character is a letter and that returns â€“1 otherwise.
